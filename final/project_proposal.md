## Project Information
- **Project Type:** Default 447
- **Task Name:** OpenBookQA

  - **Citation:**
    > Mihaylov, Todor, Peter Clark, Tushar Khot and Ashish Sabharwal. “Can a Suit of Armor Conduct Electricity? A New Dataset for Open Book Question Answering.” Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (2018).
- **Benchmark:** https://leaderboard.allenai.org/open_book_qa/submissions/public
- **Why we pick this task:**
We are fascinated by the concept of open book exams in the context of AI. Since open book exams are a classic way to test human understanding, assessing machines' ability to "understand" and apply core science facts correctly seems like a good way to measure their intelligence. We think
this will be a challenging yet rewarding task to work on.
- **Research Plan:**
  - Get a deep understanding (week 1)
    - Read the paper understand its motivation and approach
    - Browse through the papers that cite this paper understand OpenBookQA's impact on the field
    - Survey around the leaderboard and get a list of popular solutions to OpenBookQA
  - Solutions Deep Dive (week 2)
    - Pick a few solutions that we think are interesting and try to understand them in depth
    - Analyze the pros and cons of each solution
    - Propose a list potential improvements to the solutions
  - Implementation & Experimentation (week 3 & 4)
    - Pick one solution we want to improve on
    - Implement our proposed improvements
    - List out the experiments we want to run
    - Run experiments and analyze the results
