        "However, the way we processed our data for batching makes it slightly more complicated, because the loss is averaged over tokens. While this would normally be simple, recall that we insert `<PAD>` tokens as padding until 100 tokens, and the vast majority of documents are significantly less than 100 tokens. This means that most of our tokens are the long tail of `<PAD>`s.\n",

        "However, this isn't the end of the story. Ideally, we would make `<PAD>` tokens have no effect whatsoever. For this to happen, we should apply a mask out all attention to and from `<PAD>` tokens, but we chose not to include that in your required implementation. The fact that we did not implement this has no measurable impact because our minGPT fork zeros out values for `<PAD>` tokens after attention anyway."
